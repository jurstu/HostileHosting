# HostileHosting
"simple" file hosting alternative to services like nextcloud - PoC





## What should be possible with this software (TODO)

- [ ] share a folder with files inside it
    - [ ] download the whole directory inside a .zip file
    - [ ] share it with a password auth
- [ ] upload a file
    - [ ] only up to a size
    - [ ] with password auth
- [ ] both options together
- [ ] serve routes independently 
- [ ] routes are available behind hashed values to obfuscate paths
- [ ] for now, only through .json config file
